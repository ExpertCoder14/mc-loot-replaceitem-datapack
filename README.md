# MC-Shulker-Box-Pack #
A utility Minecraft Java Edition data pack to workaround player NBT.

# About #
This data pack contains a single loot table to modify the shulker box's behaviour. When broken with a stick with the NBT tag `dropContents:1b`, this will cause the shulker box to drop all its contents as well of itself. When broken with anything without that tag, the shulker box drops normally.

# Installation #

# ExpertCoder14's `loot_replaceitem` Data Packs #
Each of the above folders contains a data pack for Minecraft.
## About ##
This data pack contains a single loot table to modify the shulker box's behaviour.

When broken with a stick with the NBT tag `dropContents:1b`, this will cause the shulker box to drop its contents instead of itself, with the NBT tags correctly specified When broken with anything without that tag, the shulker box drops normally.

I made this data pack to work around a specific player NBT issue, detailed [here](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/376895/250180).
